    "# Video Download Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook handles the automated downloading of YouTube videos from participant watch histories. It implements a robust downloading system with rate limiting, error handling, and comprehensive logging.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features:\n",
    "1. Sample selection of 20 unique videos per participant\n",
    "2. Controlled download speeds to prevent rate limiting\n",
    "3. Authentication\n",
    "4. Comprehensive logging of download attempts and outcomes\n",
    "5. Automatic cleanup of unlogged/failed downloads\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical Specifications:\n",
    "- Download speed throttle: 200KB/s\n",
    "- Video format: Best quality at max 360p resolution\n",
    "- Wait time between downloads: 2-40 seconds\n",
    "- Sample size per participant: 20 videos\n",

    "    Process Overview:\n",
    "    - The function begins by setting a random seed for reproducibility and concatenates existing log files \n",
    "      to track previous downloads.\n",
    "    - It iterates through each unique participant, checking for prior download attempts and ensuring sufficient \n",
    "      videos remain for downloading.\n",
    "    - Unique videos for each participant are shuffled to randomize the download order before filtering out \n",
    "      videos that have been previously attempted or successfully downloaded.\n",
    "    - The function downloads videos until the specified sample size is achieved (or no more videos are available), \n",
    "      logging each attempt's success or failure along with relevant timing information.\n",
    "    - Random wait times are introduced between downloads to mitigate potential rate-limiting issues from the \n",
    "      video source.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Notes:\n",
    "        - The function creates log entries for each video download attempt, noting successes, failures, and \n",
    "          cases where participants do not have enough unique videos available.\n",
    "        - If a participant has already met the sample size requirement, they are skipped in subsequent runs.\n",
    "        - Ensures that each download is unique and that previously downloaded videos are not re-attempted.\n",
